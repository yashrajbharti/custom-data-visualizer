## Problem Statement for UXE

!["The Data Viz question"](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fd54ddf-63aa-4ffd-870e-ebdd8802abc5)

## **Shortcut Table**

| **Action**             | **Laptop**                          | **Phone**                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Drag a Dot**         | `Click + Drag`                      | `Touch + Move`                  |
| **Drag Focused Dot**   | `Arrow Keys`                        | `Touch + Move`                  |
| **Rotate the Sphere**  | `Hold Shift + Mouse Drag/Arrow Keys`| `Two-Finger Touch & Rotate`     |

| **Redo Last Action**   | `Ctrl + Shift + Z`                  | *Not applicable*                |

> [!TIP]
> Some data points will not be clickable as they are at the back of the sphere. Rotate the sphere to click them.

## **Bundle Size**

Running the following command:

```bash
tar -czf - app.js module/*.mjs | wc -c
```

It will give 10240 = **10 KB** when gzipped, truly compact for a 3D data viz that has all such controls and custom interactions!

## 60 FPS

The whole data viz runs at `60 FPS` and allows us to add upto **100K+** data points via something called "compartments". The sphere is divided into 64 such compartments and upon Zooming in it loads up more points from the nearest compartment. Also it keeps the maximum number of points on a zoomed out view to remain `MAX_BATCH_SIZE` which is 5000 data points.

## Performance

Performance for the desktop devices is around `88` for this data visualizer as per Chrome lighthouse report. While the main target is to use it on phone where it offers the best perfomance possible with the best practices on the web with a Performance score of `100`.

## Deep level nesting | Drag and Drop

The data points can be nested to any depth with a simple drag and drop of one point on top of the other. Hold for `1200ms` to nest them.

### Nest and Burst

Nested dots can be bursted with a double click / double tap. We can also use the shortcuts `Ctrl + Shift + M` to burst them.

### Burst a Dot into Multiple Dots

In this example, I burst a dot having deep nesting into multiple dots using keyboard shortcuts `Ctrl + M` and `Ctrl + Shift + M` to nest and burst respectively.

### Accessibility

The 3D data visualizer has keyboard support, proper semantic HTML, contrasting colors, and multiple shortcuts you may find useful. One can use `TAB` or `Shift + TAB` to visit all the data points and move them with `Up`, `Down`, `Right` and `Left` arrow keys, while pressing `Shift + Arrow keys` can rotate the 3D sphere. The touch gestures to move dots with one finger and rotate sphere with two fingers are also intuitive and works similar to how Google Maps does it.

## Architecture Overview

This project is built with a modular architecture using vanilla JavaScript ES6 modules and WebGL2 for rendering. The codebase is organized into specialized modules that handle specific concerns:

### Core Architecture

```
app.js (Main Entry Point)
â”œâ”€â”€ render.mjs           - WebGL2 rendering pipeline
â”œâ”€â”€ interactions.mjs     - User interaction handling (drag, nest, burst)
â”œâ”€â”€ loadData.mjs         - Data loading and compartment management
â”œâ”€â”€ history.mjs          - Undo/redo functionality
â””â”€â”€ store.mjs            - State persistence (zoom, rotation)
```

### Module Breakdown

**Rendering Pipeline**

- `render.mjs` - WebGL2 rendering engine with matrix transformations
- `shaders.mjs` - Vertex and fragment shader definitions
- `createShader.mjs` - WebGL shader compilation utilities
- `resize.mjs` - Canvas resizing and viewport management

**Data Management**

- `loadData.mjs` - IndexedDB integration and compartment-based loading
- `compartments.mjs` - Spatial partitioning (8x8 grid = 64 compartments)
- `sphere.mjs` - 2D to 3D sphere coordinate conversion
- `dataWorker.js` - Web Worker for processing large datasets

**Interaction System**

- `interactions.mjs` - Drag-and-drop, nesting, and bursting logic
- `eventCoordinates.mjs` - Mouse/touch coordinate normalization
- `normalize.mjs` - Point normalization to sphere surface

**3D Transformations**

- `rotateMatrix.mjs` - Rotation matrix generation
- `matrixUtils.mjs` - Matrix operations (multiply, inverse, apply)
- `centerCoordinates.mjs` - Screen-to-world coordinate conversion

**State & UI**

- `store.mjs` - LocalStorage-based state management
- `history.mjs` - Command pattern for undo/redo
- `buttonState.mjs` - UI button state management
- `info.mjs` - User feedback and status updates

### Key Technical Features

**1. Compartmentalized Data Loading**
The sphere is divided into 64 compartments (8x8 grid) to handle 100K+ data points efficiently. Only visible compartments are loaded based on zoom level and viewport position.

**2. WebGL2 Rendering**
Uses custom vertex and fragment shaders for efficient GPU-accelerated rendering at 60 FPS. Each point is rendered individually with focused state highlighting.

**3. Web Workers**
Data processing happens in a separate thread (`dataWorker.js`) to prevent UI blocking when loading large datasets.

**4. IndexedDB Storage**
Large datasets are stored in IndexedDB for persistent storage and efficient batch loading.

**5. Matrix-based Transformations**
All 3D transformations (rotation, zoom, projection) use 4x4 matrices for accurate spatial calculations.

### Data Flow

1. User uploads JSON data via `uploads.html`
2. `uploadWorker.js` processes and stores data in IndexedDB
3. `dataWorker.js` converts 2D coordinates to 3D sphere coordinates
4. Data is partitioned into 64 compartments
5. `loadData.mjs` loads initial batch (5000 points)
6. User interactions trigger re-renders via `render.mjs`
7. Zoom triggers compartment loading for additional detail

### Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy Loading**: Only 5000 points loaded initially
- **Spatial Partitioning**: 64 compartments for efficient culling
- **Web Workers**: Non-blocking data processing
- **LocalStorage**: Persistent zoom/rotation state
- **RequestAnimationFrame**: Smooth 60 FPS rendering
- **Dynamic Draw**: `gl.DYNAMIC_DRAW` for frequently updated buffers
